### About
Repository webui is the web user interface for the Project 418

You can find the UI developed here hosted at http://geodex.org.  Note this site 
is a simple prototype site.  It is designed more to give an environment to test
out API and query calls.  These calls access the various indexes that is build 
from the scheme.org/Dataset structured metadata being harvested.   This harvest is
done by the crawler code in this repo (https://github.com/earthcubearchitecture-project418/crawler).

This is not intended to be a generic search tool for geoscientists at this time.  
Rather it is here to help provide live and controllable feedback to the P418 team 
to assess elements of resource ranking and recovery by this approach.
