place holder for Adam's assay work.....

Assay page goals
- place for facilities to share methods and patterns with quick ability to connect
- place for researchers to assess how data they are looking for is being exposed.  
This can help them better tune searches but also help drive newer discovery patterns back to the 
data providers

Part of the assay should point to external vocabularies and we should highlight that. 

heat map of the data on the globe  (Eric)

also put the download to the indexes we can here.....  and encourage others to pull them down 
and contribute

build prov for the downloaded datasets....

Data coverage (maybe programmatic via framing?)
- this would look at the 17 (?) Google terms and would test resoruces to see how many 
of these they had..   the results would be agregated and presented

Assay points
* use of external vocs (table of them and # instance)
* the various types used
* spatial types used   (easier from tile38?)
* type by facility  ?   
* use of PIDs  (not how found or used)

Crawl Metadata  (prov)
